# Project Notes
Patches scripts to run agnostically of the Linux environment. This is required because SaaS migration has shown that many of the scripts we use have hard-coded paths to $HOME which requires them to be either converted to the new path paradigm, or simply patch them so they work no matter what environment they end up in.


Instructions for Running:
./patchsaas.sh [options]
